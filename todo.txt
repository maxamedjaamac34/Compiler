For Sunday:
Consolidate classes into fewer files
- fix import statements
Know what your modular pieces are doing/what you expect it to do (for debugging)
- Condense to a few sentences
- Put in triple quotes underneath the function declarations
- explain it in such a way that it's easy to tell whether its behavior is correct to someone else reading the code
Fix all Parse class inits to take in just (self, *args)
Make ParsingStructureNotFound custom exception so that you can check just for that in the try/except statements
Plan out breakpoints and what you want to see at each breakpoint

The parse classes
look at these modularly
make a function that will just try to parse an if statement
Start with the smallest thing you can
Know what your expectations are so that you know how to approach fixing it when it doesn't do that
